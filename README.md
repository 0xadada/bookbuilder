# bookbuilder

A book build system that produces PDF, EPUB and MOBI from asciidoc to Amazon specifications.

Try:

$ make LANG=en pdf

$ make LANG=es epub

The build system (/conf, Makefile) is forked and heavily modified from https://github.com/akosma/eBook-Template, which is public domain. The derivative work that adapts it for Amazon Createspace publishing is licensed under an MIT license.
